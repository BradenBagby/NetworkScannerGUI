---------------PROGRAM


Network Scanner GUI allows a user to conduct scans of type: SYN, TCP HANDSHAKE, FIN, and XMAS using a graphical user interface.
It also allows users to run a custom TCP packet with customized flags.



---------------Dependencies-----------------------

Tins:
Network Scanner GUI uses libtins for constructing custom raw packets.
installation instructions can be found on the github
github: http://libtins.github.io/

Qt:
Network Scanner GUI is built using Qt and qmake. To install qt on linux run 
$sudo apt-get qt5-default

---------------Installing----------------------

Two options:
1. Using Qt Creator (Easy)
2. Using qmake with terminal

1. Qt Creator
	1. Open ./NetworkScannerGUI/NetworkScannerGUI.pro with qt creator
	2. Build and run

2. Terminal
	1. Use qmake to generate make file:
		$qmake NetworkScannerGUI.pro -spec linux-g++ CONFIG+=debug CONFIG+=qml_debug && /usr/bin/make qmake_all

			Note: if "qmake: could not find a Qt installation of ''" You are using the wrong version of qmake. Make sure you use the right version. For example, my version 
			full path is "/home/bradenbagby/Qt/5.11.1/gcc_64/bin/qmake". You may need to specify the absolute path to qmake when running the command

	2. Run make using the newly generated make file
		$make

Note: if there are errors trying to run qmake make sure you're permissions on all of the files are correct

	3. Make generates NetworkScannerGUI executable in the directory
